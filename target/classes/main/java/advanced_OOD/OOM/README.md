# Object-Oriented Metrics (OOM)

This package is for creating small programmes for the understanding of the OOM .
Object-Oriented Metrics are quantitative measurements used to assess the quality of object-oriented software. These metrics help ensure the software is maintainable, scalable, and efficient.

## Topics Covered in OOM

### 1. **Cohesion**
- **Definition**: Measures how strongly related the functionalities of a single class are.
- **Key Concept**: High cohesion means a class has a single, focused responsibility.
- **Example**: Separating user authentication logic, payment processing logic, and notification logic into different classes.

### 2. **Coupling**
- **Definition**: Measures the degree of dependency between different classes.
- **Key Concept**: Low coupling is preferred for better modularity and flexibility.
- **Example**: Using dependency injection to decouple services in a system.

### 3. **Depth of Inheritance Tree (DIT)**
- **Definition**: Measures the maximum depth of inheritance for a class.
- **Key Concept**: A shallow inheritance tree is generally better for maintainability.
- **Example**: Avoiding deep inheritance hierarchies in product classifications.

### 4. **Cyclomatic Complexity**
- **Definition**: Measures the number of independent paths through a program's source code.
- **Key Concept**: Lower complexity means easier testing and debugging.
- **Example**: Refactoring a method with multiple conditional branches into smaller methods or using polymorphism.

## Benefits of Object-Oriented Metrics
- **Improved Maintainability**: Identifies areas in the codebase that are harder to maintain.
- **Better Design**: Promotes single-responsibility classes and modular designs.
- **Enhanced Testability**: Encourages lower complexity for simpler and more effective testing.
- **Scalability**: Ensures the application can grow with minimal refactoring.

## Tools for Measuring OOM
- **SonarQube**: Provides insights into cohesion, coupling, and cyclomatic complexity.
- **IntelliJ IDEA Metrics Plugin**: Offers metrics like DIT, coupling, and cohesion.
- **JDepend**: Analyzes design quality and dependency structures in Java projects.

## Summary
Object-Oriented Metrics provide a framework for evaluating and improving the design and quality of object-oriented software. By understanding and applying these metrics, developers can build robust, maintainable, and scalable systems.
