## **Introduction**
This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding and applying Object-Oriented Design principles. It covers both foundational and advanced topics with a focus on practical implementation. Whether you're a beginner or looking to enhance your OOD skills, this repo is for you.

## **Concepts Covered**

### **1. Core OOD Principles**
- **Encapsulation**: Protect the integrity of objects by restricting direct access to their internal state.  
- **Abstraction**: Focus on essential properties while hiding unnecessary details.  
- **Inheritance**: Reuse code through parent-child relationships between classes.  
- **Polymorphism**: Achieve flexibility by allowing objects to take on multiple forms.

### **2. Advanced OOP Concepts**
- **Composition Over Inheritance**:  
  Use composition to build flexible and maintainable systems by combining smaller, reusable components.  
- **Generic Classes and Methods**:  
  Write reusable and type-safe code with Java Generics.  
- **Reflection and Metadata**:  
  Access and manipulate class metadata at runtime to build dynamic systems.  
- **Dynamic Polymorphism**:  
  Leverage runtime method overriding and interfaces for dynamic behavior.  
- **Encapsulation with Access Modifiers**:  
  Protect object integrity using proper access control (private, protected, etc.).

### **3. Design Patterns**
- **Creational Patterns**:  
  - Singleton  
  - Factory  
  - Builder  

- **Structural Patterns**:  
  - Adapter  
  - Composite  

- **Behavioral Patterns**:  
  - Strategy  
  - Observer  
  - Template Method

## **Project Examples**
This repository includes practical examples to demonstrate OOD concepts, such as:
1. **Shopping System**:  
   - Demonstrates generic methods for item management and encapsulation.
2. **Library Management System**:  
   - Implements inheritance and polymorphism for book and user management.
3. **Employee Management System**:  
   - Shows the use of design patterns like Factory and Strategy.
4. **Dynamic Configuration Loader**:  
   - Utilizes Reflection and Metadata for runtime configurations.
